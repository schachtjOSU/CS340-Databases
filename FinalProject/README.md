Homebrew database project

CS340- Introduction to Databases

Authors: Saul Gonzalez and Jeffrey Schachtsick

Homebrew database project. The database stores the quantity of ingredients a homebrewer has on hand. The homebrewer uses the ingredient on hand to create new beers. He can add new ingredients to the database as needed. He tracks all the ingredients that make up each beer by creating unique recipes for each beer. A recipe is made up of all the ingredients that make up the beer. The homebrewer can also modify an existing recipe to enhance the flavor by adding more ingredients to the recipe. 
 
Keeping track of the ingredients each beer is made of will enhance the beer making process. This will help make changes to the recipe more efficient. Having an organized way to keep track of this information will give the homebrewer the ability to focus on creating great tasting beers.
